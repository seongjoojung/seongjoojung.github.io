            <p>We need to talk about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volta_potential">Volta potential</a>. Users of quantum mechanical simulations like such as density functional theory, including myself, often overlooks &quot;classical&quot; thinking of electrostatic field. In most of finite-sized or continuous boundary calculations, local electric field (defined as negative gradient of electric potential) does not mean much. The electric potential changes rapidly near ions and electrons densities, and the total field averages to zero. But that may not be true, if your system is assymetrically charged. And having two different conductors in your system can easily make your system assymetrically charged.</p>
<p>Volta potential is essentially the same potential difference as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvani_potential">Galvani potential</a> between two conductors, but separated by a distance. It is the potential difference driven by alignment of the Fermi level of two conductors with different work functions, when they are brought into electrical contact.</p>
<p><img src="/images/volta-potential/Cu-Pt.png" alt="Cu-Pt" title="Cu-Pt"></p>
<p>Consider a system of two separated slabs of different metals, 4-layer Cu(100) (represented as blue spheres) and Pt(100) (represented as gray spheres). With a bit of biaxial strains in both slabs, the <a href="https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Ni_111_surface_high_precision">calculated workfunctions</a> are 4.41 and 5.77 eV respectively. While they look perfectly separated, the Volta potential forms between the electrodes and there is charge transfer from Cu slab (with lower workfunction) to Pt slab (with high workfunction). That is because in DFT calculations, electrons in the in the whole unit cell occupy states represented by wave functions, also of the whole unit cell. The states are occupied starting with the ones with the lowest eigenvalue, regardless of from which ion they originate. Since the only one Fermi level can be assigned for the unit cell, all the conductors in single DFT calculations can be thought as electrically connected by an external wire.</p>
<p>Volta potential is not an artifact of DFT calculations, it is a real effect. If two infinitely large metal slabs (electrodes) with different work functions were connected by external wire, uniform electric field would form between the electrodes. If it's real - does it mean that it's not problematic? Unfortunately not. The what makes the Volta potential problematic is the scale of the DFT calculations. In experiments, the parrellel plate electrodes are often separated by over ~100 nm. In this length scale, the magnitude of electric field formed by the Volta potential would not be too significant. However, it is not easy to simulate electrodes separated by over 100 nm in DFT calculations, let alone 100 Å. The length between the electrodes is simplified and shortened dramatically, and so does the magnitude of the electric field formed by the Volta potential.</p>
